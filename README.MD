# Basic Clock Project

This project is meant as a demonstration of skills and knowledge from WidesðŸŽ¸, the self taught developer,
mediocre philosopher, ugly bard, and village idiot...

Within this simple project I display a digital clock that updates per users timezone and
displays the date. Vanilla Web Technologies used for demonstration of basic functionalities.

## Deployed to Github Pages
https://techsageogden.github.io/clock/ to see the live demonstration for this project.
